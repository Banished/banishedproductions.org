_Greenwood Follies & Other Old French Plays_ featured the world premiere of three 13th century comedies translated by John DuVal, a nationally acclaimed poet and French scholar who was awarded an NEA grant for his research and translation of Adam de la Halle’s Greenwood Follies, one of the readings in this festival. The two other plays read were _The Miracle of Theophile_, and an excerpt from _The Play of Adam_. Published as the collection “From Adam to Adam: Seven Old French Plays”, these English translations of a variety of medieval street drama sparkle with humor and poignancy and are wonderfully accessible to a modern audience. John DuVal honored the event by introducing these plays.

Posters and copies of the book “From Adam to Adam: Seven Old French Plays” (co-authored by John DuVal and Raymond Eichmann) from which the readings are culled, were available for sale by Pegasus Press.
