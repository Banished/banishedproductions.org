“For those with a predilection for THEATER THAT WANDERS OUT OF BOUNDS. (A) soothing new performance piece (that) cocoons an audience in the music & imagery of popular culture. The effect is both familiar & mysterious.” – [The Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/theater-floating-evocatively-in-a-young-womans-reverie/2012/02/22/gIQA9R8KUR_story.html)

_Into the Dollhouse_ is an original devised-movement performance that explores girlhood, nostalgia and looking back in order to walk forward. The piece takes inspiration from Meredith Monk’s _Education of the Girl Child_, Anna Halprin’s _Parades & Changes_, selected text from Charles Mee’s _Salome_, and songs from yesteryear that trigger reminiscing.

_Into the Dollhouse_ was selected in November 2012 for the inaugural Arena Stage Cradle series. The piece, which made its world premiere at the Flashpoint Mead Theatre Lab, continues banished? productions‘ signature of using the stage as a canvas on which to immerse audiences in a collaborative hybrid theatre form that uses narrative, movement, text, music and sculpture.
