#### Manage Flickr photo metatdata

Proper title, description and tagging in flickr will ensure the photos appear on the about page with no frills. All the photos should be uploaded in the photoset [Banished Treehouse](http://www.flickr.com/photos/100588115@N07/with/13080602745). Here's what you need to do as you add a new person to the set:

- `tag`: `engineer`, `collaborater`, or `treehouse`. Proper tagging will place the egg in the right bucket :)
