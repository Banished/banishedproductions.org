“As experiential theater goes, this effort, by the D.C.-based banished? productions and artistic director Carmen C. Wong makes for a giddy little refreshment.” -- [Washington Post](http://voices.washingtonpost.com/goingoutgurus/2009/07/a_tactile_dinner_whimsicality.html) 

“A “once-in-a-lifetime” kind of show… that reawakens the senses of its audience. -- [We Love DC](http://www.welovedc.com/2009/07/09/eat-like-a-kid-again-a-tactile-dining-experience/)
