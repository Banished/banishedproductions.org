**Other Reviews**

“(An) intelligent and compelling new performance piece…The revealing peek they offer at some of our most simple, perpetual behaviors…is worth the trip through the little front door” -- [DC Theatre Scene](http://dctheatrescene.com/2012/02/22/into-the-dollhouse/)

“The experience is quite unlike anything you’ll ever have…the best way to truly enjoy this incredible creation is to go to the Flashpoint Mead Theatre Lab” -- [Maryland Theatre Guide](http://mdtheatreguide.com/2012/02/into-the-dollhouse-at-banished-productions/)
