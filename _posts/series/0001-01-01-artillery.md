The banished? ARTillery is a flexible, mixed-use space for banished? productions' avant-pop hybrid art practice, housing:

- a fully-equipped wood/technical workshop 
- a conceptual gastro-art laboratory 
- a shop for the salable art and artifacts created within its walls 
- an innovative classroom and work/design studio for collaborators

The banished? ARTillery is home to two programs:   
[ARTillery Tool Library](/artillery/artillery-tool-library) where members can check out hand tools or power tools for projects.  

[ARTillery Academy](/artillery/artillery-academy) which offers classes designed to peer-teach artists and audiences skills and techniques that inform banished?â€™s hybrid-arts and interdisciplinary approach to avant-pop performances.
