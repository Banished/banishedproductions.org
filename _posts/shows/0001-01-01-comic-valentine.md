Based on actual comic book stories from over fifty years ago, _My Comic Valentine_ examines the culture and values of the early â€™50s through a contemporary lens, challenging conservative stereotypes and affirming universal truths in the never-ending search for true love. A living comic book with all the elements, from cover to cover including the ads and letters, _My Comic Valentine_ brings heart, humor and sheer pre-code sauciness to THE SHOP at Fort Fringe in four-color splendor.
