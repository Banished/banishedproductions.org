subtitle: shadows in the garden

Inspired by the success of _Ballades Mechanique (ver 1.0)_, Version 2.0 was created to continue banished?’s exploration into finding new narrative forms, this time with shadowplay.

This project was commissioned by CityBlossoms – an urban gardening non-profit that works with children and communities. _Ballades Mechanique (ver 2.0)_ uses three “reels” of shadows in a meditative montage-story of what is, what used to be and what is to come into the vacant lot now home to the Marion Street Intergenerational Garden.
