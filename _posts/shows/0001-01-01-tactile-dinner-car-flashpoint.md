The Futurist-inspired, mobile gastro-performance that premiered at the 2011 CapFringe made a pit-stop at Flashpoint Gallery Sept 9-24, 2011.  

Pulling inspiration for its shape from the Bugatti that founded Futurism, Buckminster Fuller’s Dymaxion Car, Ernest Trova’s “Falling Man” sculpture and the Mercedes F-Cell Roadster among many other influences, the TACTILE DINNER CAR aims to mobilize the pseudo-edible Futuristic fusion of cuisine and theatre. T_actile Dinner Car at Flashpoint_ will serve up playfully audacious “dishes” appropriated from F.T. Marinetti’s Futurist Cookbook, a tome of avant-garde experiments that use jarring sensory experiences to renew the art of eating.
