_Greenwood Follies & Other Old French Plays_ featured the world premiere of three 13th century comedies translated by John DuVal, a nationally acclaimed poet and French scholar who was awarded an NEA grant for his research and translation of Adam de la Halle’s _Greenwood Follies_, one of the readings in this festival. The two other plays read were _The Miracle of Theophile_, and an excerpt from _The Play of Adam_. Published as the collection “From Adam to Adam: Seven Old French Plays”, these English translations of a variety of medieval street drama sparkle with humor and poignancy and are wonderfully accessible to a modern audience. John DuVal honored the event by introducing these plays.

Posters and copies of the book “From Adam to Adam: Seven Old French Plays” (co-authored by John DuVal and Raymond Eichmann) from which the readings are culled, were available for sale by Pegasus Press.
