TYGER looks at fragmentation, poetry, love, and other meditations on the holes in our lives. This devised piece interrogates ritual as a means to resolve loss while grappling with the plurality of truth. Text was drawn from selected writings of Jorge Luis Borges, Jose Rivera’s _Brainpeople_, and works by the No Inglés collective.
