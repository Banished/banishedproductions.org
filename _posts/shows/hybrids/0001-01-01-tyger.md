TYGER looks at fragmentation, poetry, love, and other meditations on the holes in our lives, drawing from selected writings of Jorge Luis Borges, Jose Rivera’s Brainpeople, and works by the No Inglés collective. The piece interrogates ritual as a means to resolve loss while grappling with the plurality of truth.
