"Like an old perfume bottle of attar of roses, with a little saucy kick." -- [welovedc.com](http://www.welovedc.com/2010/07/11/fringe-2010-handbook-for-hosts/)

Based on Esquire’s 1949 Handbook for Hosts, this performance mélange brings to life a goldmine of consummate recipes from a time when men were men, dames wore gloves, and sloe gin fizzed.
