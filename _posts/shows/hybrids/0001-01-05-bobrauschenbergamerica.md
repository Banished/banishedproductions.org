“It’s a creative party, low-key, intimate, and genuinely celebratory — truly a mood-altering show.” [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/22/AR2007072201080.html?sub=new) 

A trip through a wildly familiar landscape in a play as one of America’s greatest painters might have conceived: a Rauschenberg-esque collage of people, places, icons, music and dancing, of love stories and the sheer exhilaration of living in a country where people make up their lives as they go.
