## I Thought the Earth Remembered Me

Wander and play within five intimate performance vignettes that ponder our relationships with nature, time and how we enact and embody belonging and rootedness. Weâ€™ll story our intricate connections to home and land, and to spores, sprouts and microbes in living, intangible kingdoms.
