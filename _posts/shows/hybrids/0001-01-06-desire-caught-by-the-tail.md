“(...) a freewheeling interpretation with little of Picasso’s stage direction followed to the letter. The artist would have approved, for what good is it to pay homage to creative genius by re-creating his work if it’s done in a way that is predictable and uncreative?” - [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/21/AR2006072101452.html) 

Gripped by the 1941 Nazi occupation of Paris, Picasso abandoned his brushes to write this surreal dark comedy. banished? productions and BosmaDance have created a disquieting dance and multimedia menage of motley characters who seek escape from wartime deprivation with acts of sensual indulgence: cooking, sex and poetry.
