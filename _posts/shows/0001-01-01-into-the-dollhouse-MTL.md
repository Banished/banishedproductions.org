“For those with a predilection for THEATER THAT WANDERS OUT OF BOUNDS. (A) soothing new performance piece (that) cocoons an audience in the music & imagery of popular culture. The effect is both familiar & mysterious.” – [The Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/theater-floating-evocatively-in-a-young-womans-reverie/2012/02/22/gIQA9R8KUR_story.html)

_Into the Dollhouse_ is an original devised-movement performance that explores girlhood, nostalgia and looking back in order to walk forward. The piece takes inspiration from Meredith Monk’s _Education of the Girl Child_, Anna Halprin’s _Parades & Changes_, selected text from Charles Mee’s _Salome_, and songs from yesteryear that trigger reminiscing.
