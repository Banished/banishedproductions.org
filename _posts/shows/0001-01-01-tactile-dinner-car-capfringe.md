The futuristic gastro-performance hit of the 2009 CapFringe is back…streamlined and MOBILE…and dishing up bite-sized portions of our “daringly interactive meal-like extravaganza” (WashPost) to tantalize all five senses!

A chef from another place and time arrives with his speechless sidekick and tries to make sense of the brave new world and the people and food in it. The performance is a gentle satire on food trucks, Futurism, and an exploration of our collective food consciousness.

This debut of _Tactile Dinner Car_ was presented as part of the 2011 Capital Fringe Festival. Tickets sold in 15-minute increments during the operation hours. Length of each person’s experience will be self-determined.
