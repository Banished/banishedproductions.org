“hands-down the most inventive item on tonight’s Fringe menu” -- [Washington City Paper](http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/fringe/2011/07/07/tonight-theyre-gonna-rock-you-tonight-being-an-unscientific-guide-to-bet-hedging-as-capital-fringe-vi-begins/#more-3881)

“A Merry-go-round of sensory overload” -- [welovedc.com](http://www.welovedc.com/2011/07/09/fringe-2011-tactile-dinner-car/)

A chef from another place and time arrives with his speechless sidekick and tries to make sense of the brave new world and the people and food in it. The performance is a gentle satire on food trucks, Futurism, and an exploration of our collective food consciousness.

This debut of _Tactile Dinner Car_ was presented as part of the 2011 Capital Fringe Festival. Tickets sold in 15-minute increments during the operation hours. Length of each person’s experience was self-determined.
