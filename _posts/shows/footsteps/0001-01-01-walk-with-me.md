The first of the new [banished? footsteps]({{site.baseurl}}/footsteps) series, _Walk With Me_ takes you on a brisk tour of the Columbia Heights and Mount Pleasant neighborhoods in Washington, DC. Immerse yourself in the three stories of people who call this neighborhood home and be woven into the fabric of a living urban art adventure.

To launch this series, we organized a mass-walk of _Walk With Me_ on Dec 12, 2010 at 12:00noon and 3:00pm. In partnership with the Mt. Pleasant Temporium (3068 Mt. Pleasant St NW), we also organized a mass-walk on Feb 27 & Mar 6, 2011 at 11:00am
