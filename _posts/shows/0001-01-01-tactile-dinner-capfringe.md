“This is no show, it is an experience, and one I exhort you not to miss.” -- [Washington City Paper](http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/fringe/2009/07/13/hip-shot-a-tactile-dinner/)

Viva la degustacione!  Marking the 100th anniversary of Futurism, banished? productions cordially invites everyone to celebrate the passé-ist glory of Futurist degustation: a tactile seven-course “meal” of gastronomic revolution! Pasta Prohibited! This performance debuted at the 2009 Capital Fringe Festival.
