_Tactile Morsels_ is an edible installation that combines a futurist, dystopic childhood fantasy with uniquely flavored lollipops set amidst a tactile landscape that includes small-scale video projection and audio. By eating part of the art, while interacting with the audio and visual elements, the piece playfully upends the prescribed behaviors of art-viewing. In the act of consuming the art, viewers become performers for each other, thereby activating the artwork and the space around.

The first iteration was created for the CulturalDC Connect Gala (April 2012). The second version was installed in a bathroom at the Capitol Skyline Hotel for the (e)merge art fair (October 2012).
