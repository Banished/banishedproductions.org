“This daringly interactive, philosophically pungent, meal-like extravaganza is designed to spatula audiences out of their comfort zones — theatrical and gustatory — and instill a new appreciation of sensory experience.”

The 2009 Capfringe hit is back – this time with 10 “courses” for vegetarians at the Big Bear Café.
