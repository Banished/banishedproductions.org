"Like an old perfume bottle of attar of roses, with a little saucy kick." -- [welovedc.com](http://www.welovedc.com/2010/07/11/fringe-2010-handbook-for-hosts/)

Based on Esquire’s 1949 Handbook for Hosts, this performance mélange brings to life a goldmine of consummate recipes from a time when men were men, dames wore gloves, and sloe gin fizzed. This performance was presented as a part of the 2010 Capital Fringe Festival: Fri, 7/9: 8pm, Sat, 7/10: 10pm, Thu, 7/15: 10:15pm, Sat, 7/17: 1pm, Sun, 7/18: 5:30pm, Sat, 7/24: 8pm
