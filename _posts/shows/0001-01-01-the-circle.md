The second installation of the [banished? footsteps](/footsteps) series, The Circle pulls time, space and audiences together by combining a 70′s-inspired narrative and sound with present-day urban structures and surroundings. For this 2012 CapFringe event, walkers experienced live action games within the Carnegie Library grounds. In this urban green space where real life meets , they tapped into a surreal story of a woman tripping through past and future memory, one that weaves personal anecdotes of Dupont Circle in the 1970′s as seen through the eyes of the young and restless.
