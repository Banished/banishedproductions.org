The second installation of the [banished? footsteps](/footsteps) series, The Circle pulls time, space and audiences together by combining a 70′s-inspired narrative and sound with present-day urban structures and surroundings. For this 2012 CapFringe event, walkers experienced live action games within the Carnegie Library grounds. In this urban green space where real life meets , they tapped into a surreal story of a woman tripping through past and future memory, one that weaves personal anecdotes of Dupont Circle in the 1970′s as seen through the eyes of the young and restless.

The Circle debuted on July 12 at the 2012 Capital Fringe Festival and made its Dupont Circle debut ( on September 26, 2012. Through public spaces close by the Festival grounds, audience members walked, listened and lived the secrets and memories of The Circle.
