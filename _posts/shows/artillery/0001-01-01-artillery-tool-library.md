Our Tool Library is geared toward artists and community members in DC who wish to borrow tools to create sets, props and other art and design projects. We have 2 levels of membership designed to allow affordable options for everyone.

Approved members are welcome to borrow up to 7 tools for up to 7 days (one week) at a time. There is a 3 tool limit on power (i.e. corded and rechargeable) tools. 

Available tools, pictures, and descriptions are listed on our Local Tools website. This site will indicate whether an item is available or not at that moment.

Tools are available on a first-come, first-served basis during Open Hours: Tuesdays and Thursdays (6:30PM-9:30PM) and Saturdays (10AM-2PM). 

A knowledgeable staff member or volunteer will be available to answer questions and explain/demonstrate tools if necessary. No idea what tools you need? Drop by anyway and we’ll help you determine what you need.

Tools may only be returned during open hours. Tools that are not returned by the one-week deadline incur a daily fee of $1 per tool. If a tool isn’t returned, is severely delinquent, or damaged upon return, the Member who borrowed it will be responsible for the full replacement cost.

We accept tool donations! Bring them by during open hours.

Notes:  One membership = one person, rather than one group or theater company. Membership is contingent on completion of the Membership Application and approval by the organizers.  

»Pay your fee & Sign the Borrower’s Agreement & Liability Waiver

Upon your application’s approval you will have to review and return signed copies of the Borrower’s Agreement and Tool Use Policy and the Liability Waiver and Indemnification before you can check out your first tool. Copies are available onsite or you may download them by clicking on the above links, print, fill and bring them to the open hours where you can bring/make your payment. Once payment and the necessary waivers are received, you will be allowed to borrow the tools. 

»Sign up for Volunteer Hours 

All approved members must attend one 1-hour information and training session before fulfilling Volunteer Hours. It will be a good time to meet other members, snacks will be provided, and you will be able to sign up for your hours after this training. 

Volunteer tasks may include the following: preparing tools prior to check-out, checking inventory, returning and repairing tools, etc. You have one calendar year (from the date of your membership approval) to fulfill your requisite Volunteer Hours.
