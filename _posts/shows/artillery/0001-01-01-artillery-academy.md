# How It Works

**Basic Techniques** Classes will be offered monthly, and are open on a first-come, first-serve basis. Registrations are generally limited to 16 students at maximum.

**Basic Techniques** Fees:

- Single Session - $30
- 3-class pass - $75

_Note: these may not cover additional material fees for some classes._

We plan on offering more advanced courses and creative jam sessions after 2014 and are always open to feedback. Check back soon.
