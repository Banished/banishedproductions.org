The _Tactile Anacostia-Workshop_ series preserves the food stories of residents in Anacostia and neighboring Ward 8.  After meeting and interviews, specific food activities were selected to exhibit and celebrate some of the food stories collected. Neighbors were invited to help create ephemeral art, perform, taste or take home these Anacostia-grown edible stories that they have collectively preserved. The workshops were presented as part of the Lumen8Anacostia Festival.
