“It manages the rare trick in avant-garde performance of not taking itself too seriously, of embracing the audience rather than intentionally alienating it: think Top Chef hosted by Stephen Colbert.” -- [ReadySetDC](http://readysetdc.com/2010/05/grabbing-a-tactile-dinner-2/)

The 2009 Capfringe hit is back – this time with an Italian Aperitivo and 15 indulgent omnivorous “courses” at Long View Gallery.
