name: A Tactile Taste of Helsinki
---

_A Tactile Taste of Helsinki_ strives to elevate the everyday meal by gathering all five senses in the enjoyment and consumption of each dish. This menu was created as an impressionistic tasting of Helsinki in the eyes and tastebuds of a curious eater visiting the city. Each of the dishes has been named after a place and time that inspired its creation. The experience that enfolds is embedded in basic human-connectedness. By the simple act of eating, diners are not only connected to fellow-diners in the frame of a communal performance, but also invited to the witness the artist’s moment of space-time-taste creation.
