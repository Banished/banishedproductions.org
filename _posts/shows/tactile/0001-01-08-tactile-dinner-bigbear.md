“This daringly interactive, philosophically pungent, meal-like extravaganza is designed to spatula audiences out of their comfort zones — theatrical and gustatory — and instill a new appreciation of sensory experience.”
-- [The Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/gog/performing-arts/a-tactile-dinner,1157229/critic-review.html) 

The 2009 Capfringe hit is back – this time with 10 “courses” for vegetarians at the Big Bear Café.
